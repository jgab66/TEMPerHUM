# TEMPerHUM
Windows software for reading TEMPerHUM USB sensor

This is the original code v.21.8 from PCsensor that is no loger available from the website http://pcsensor.com/ Actually, the website seems to be down since a long time ago.

Linux python code is also available for reading only the temperature senso but not the humidity one at: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/temperusb
